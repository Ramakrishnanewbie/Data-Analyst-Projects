# Personal Finance Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Personal Finance Dashboard represents my journey to gain better visibility and control over my personal finances. As someone who wanted to make more informed financial decisions, I recognized the need for a comprehensive view of my income, expenses, and savings patterns. Using Power BI, I transformed my financial data into an interactive dashboard that provides clear insights into my spending habits and savings progress.

## Business Context

Managing personal finances effectively requires understanding where money comes from and where it goes. This dashboard addresses several key questions:

- How effective are current saving strategies?

## Data Sources

The dashboard is built using data from:
- Bank account statements
- Credit card transactions
- Investment accounts

- Manual expense tracking

All sensitive information has been anonymized while preserving the analytical value of the data.
