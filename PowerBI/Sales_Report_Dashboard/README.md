# Sales Report Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Sales Report Dashboard represents a comprehensive solution to a critical business challenge faced by a multi-product manufacturer with global distribution. The organization struggled with fragmented sales data across multiple systems, making it difficult to gain a unified view of revenue and profitability. Department heads were making decisions based on incomplete information, while executives lacked the tools to understand performance trends across products, categories, and markets.

I developed this Power BI solution to consolidate disparate sales data into a cohesive analytical platform that provides clear insights into revenue patterns, product performance, and profitability drivers across all markets and timeframes.

## Business Context

In today's competitive manufacturing environment, understanding detailed sales performance is essential for strategic decision-making. This dashboard addresses several key business questions:

- How is revenue distributed across different products and subcategories?
- Which products generate the highest revenue and profit margins?
- How do sales fluctuate throughout the year across different markets?
- What is the relationship between revenue, cost, and profit across the product portfolio?
- How do products perform when comparing year-over-year metrics?
- Which markets show the strongest growth potential or concerning decline?

## Data Sources & Structure

The dashboard integrates data from multiple business systems:
- ERP transaction records
