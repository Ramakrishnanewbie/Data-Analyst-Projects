# Supermarket Sales Dashboard

## Project Story

This Supermarket Sales Dashboard began when a retail chain was struggling to understand their sales performance across different categories, payment methods, and time periods. The management team was making decisions based on incomplete spreadsheet reports that took days to compile and offered limited analytical capabilities. With increasing competition in the supermarket industry, they needed a tool that would provide immediate insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences.

I developed this Power BI solution to transform their transaction data into an interactive dashboard that reveals sales patterns, highlights top-performing products and categories, and enables data-driven inventory and marketing decisions.

## Business Context

Modern supermarkets operate on thin margins and face intense competition, making it crucial to optimize every aspect of operations. This dashboard addresses several critical business questions:

- Which products and categories generate the highest revenue and profit?
- How do sales fluctuate throughout the year, month, and day?
- What payment methods do customers prefer for different transaction types?
- Which sales types (online, in-store) perform best for specific categories?
- How effective are current promotions and pricing strategies?
- What trends might impact future inventory and staffing decisions?

## Data Sources

The dashboard is built using comprehensive transaction data:
- Point-of-sale transaction records
- Product catalog with categorization
- Promotional activity records
- Customer payment information
- Store operational data
