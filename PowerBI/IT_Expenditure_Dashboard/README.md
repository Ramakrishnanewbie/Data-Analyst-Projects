# IT Expenditure Dashboard

## Project Background

This IT Expenditure Dashboard originated from a critical business challenge in a global enterprise. The organization was struggling with IT budget transparency and governance across multiple business units, countries, and cost categories. The finance team had limited visibility into actual versus planned IT spending, making it difficult to identify budget variances and forecast future expenditures accurately. Department heads lacked the tools to understand their technology spending patterns relative to corporate plans.

I developed this Power BI solution to transform complex financial data into an intuitive dashboard that provides clear visibility into IT expenditure patterns, budget variances, and spending trends across the organization.

## Business Context

Managing IT expenditure effectively is crucial for modern enterprises dealing with complex technology landscapes. This dashboard addresses several key business questions:

- How does actual IT spending compare to planned budgets and forecasts?
- Which business areas or departments are exceeding or under-utilizing their IT budgets?
- What IT cost elements consume the largest portions of the budget?
- How do IT expenditures vary across countries and regions?
- Which spending variances require immediate attention?
- What spending trends might impact future budget planning?

## Data Foundation

The dashboard integrates financial data from multiple sources:
- ERP system financial transactions
- IT budget planning documents
- Cost allocation systems
- Departmental accounting records
- Project management systems

## Key Insights & Findings

The dashboard revealed several critical business insights:

1. **Budget Utilization Pattern**: The organization is currently at 62.0% of its IT budget plan, indicating significant underspending that could impact project timelines and technology initiatives.

2. **Geographic Spending Variations**: The United Kingdom ($13.2M) and France ($7.4M) show the largest positive variances, while some European countries like Spain, Slovakia, and Hungary show negative variances, indicating potential resource allocation issues.

3. **Business Unit Analysis**: Infrastructure represents the highest spending business area, followed by Office & Administrative functions, with these two areas consuming over 50% of the IT budget.

4. **Cost Element Distribution**: The largest cost element is Regular Salaries (20.19%), followed by Professional Services (15.82%), demonstrating the significant personnel component of IT expenditure.

5. **Functional Area Insight**: BU Support and Infrastructure functions show the highest spending within IT functional areas, highlighting where technology resources are being concentrated.
