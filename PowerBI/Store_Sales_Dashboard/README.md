# Apparel Sales Dashboard

## Project Background

This Apparel Sales Dashboard was developed to address critical business challenges faced by a major clothing and footwear retailer operating across multiple regions, channels, and product categories. Prior to this solution, the company struggled with fragmented sales data scattered across various systems, making it difficult to identify performance trends, optimize inventory, and allocate marketing resources effectively. Department heads had limited visibility into cross-category performance, while executives lacked the tools to understand regional variations and channel effectiveness.

I created this Power BI solution to transform raw transaction data into an interactive, insight-rich dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across all dimensions of the business, enabling data-driven decisions to drive growth and profitability.

## Business Context

In the competitive apparel retail industry, understanding detailed sales patterns is essential for success. This dashboard addresses several key business questions:

- How do sales performance and profitability vary across different regions?
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue and margins?
- How effective are different sales channels (in-store, outlet, online)?
- What are the relationships between unit sales and revenue across product lines?
- Which retailers contribute most significantly to overall performance?
- How do sales fluctuate seasonally, and which products show counter-cyclical trends?

## Data Sources & Structure

The dashboard integrates data from multiple business systems:
- Point-of-sale transaction records
- Inventory management system
- Product catalog with categorization
- Retailer partnership database
- Geographic market data
