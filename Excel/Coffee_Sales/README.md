# Coffee Orders Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Background

This project was inspired by my passion for both data analysis and coffee culture. As specialty coffee consumption continues to grow globally, understanding customer preferences and purchasing patterns becomes increasingly valuable for coffee retailers and roasters. 

I wanted to create a comprehensive analysis tool that could help a coffee business answer crucial questions: Which products drive the most sales? How do customer preferences vary by region? What are the emerging trends in coffee consumption? When are peak ordering times?

Using a dataset of coffee orders, I've built an interactive Excel dashboard that transforms transaction data into actionable insights for coffee business decision-makers.

## Business Context

The specialty coffee industry faces several analytical challenges:
- Understanding evolving customer preferences across different demographics
- Optimizing product mix and pricing for maximum profitability
- Identifying regional trends and preferences for targeted marketing
- Managing inventory effectively based on ordering patterns
- Tracking sales performance across products, regions, and time periods

This Excel project addresses these challenges by providing a data-driven framework for coffee business intelligence.

## Dataset Description

The analysis is based on a comprehensive coffee orders dataset containing:
- Order details (dates, order IDs, quantities)
- Customer information (names, customer types, locations)
- Product specifics (coffee types, roast levels, sizes, prices)
- Sales metrics (revenue, units sold)
- Geographic information (regions, countries, states)

## Excel Techniques Demonstrated

This project showcases several advanced Excel capabilities:

### Data Management & Cleaning
- Power Query for data import and transformation
- Custom data validation rules for maintaining data integrity
- Duplicate order identification and handling
- Text functions for standardizing inconsistent entries
- Date functions for time-based grouping and analysis

### Analysis Methods
- Pivot Tables for multi-dimensional sales analysis
- SUMIFS and COUNTIFS for conditional aggregation
- Lookup functions for connecting related data points
- Array formulas for complex calculations
- Statistical analysis for identifying trends and outliers

### Dashboard Development
- Dynamic charts linked to interactive controls
- Slicers for intuitive filtering of data
- Form controls for parameter selection
- Conditional formatting for visual highlighting
- Custom number formatting for clear metrics presentation
- Data validation lists for user-controlled views

## Key Insights & Findings

The analysis revealed several valuable insights for coffee business strategy:

1. **Product Popularity**: Light roast coffee consistently outsells medium and dark roasts, with a notable preference for Ethiopian and Colombian origins among light roast enthusiasts.

2. **Size Distribution**: While 1lb bags generate the highest total revenue, 12oz bags have the highest profit margin and are increasingly popular among urban customers.

3. **Regional Preferences**: Significant regional variation exists in coffee preferencesâ€”Western regions favor light roasts and single-origin offerings, while Midwestern customers show stronger loyalty to dark roasts and blends.

4. **Seasonal Patterns**: Order volume peaks during morning hours (7-9am) and shows a secondary peak in the early afternoon (2-3pm), with weekday orders significantly outpacing weekend orders.

5. **Customer Segmentation**: Subscription customers spend 42% more annually than one-time purchasers and show stronger loyalty to specific origins and roast profiles.

## Dashboard Features

The interactive Excel dashboard provides:

- **Sales Overview**: Top-level metrics on revenue, units sold, and average order value
- **Product Analysis**: Breakdown by coffee type, roast level, and size
- **Customer Insights**: Purchase patterns across customer segments
- **Geographic View**: Regional and state-level sales distribution
- **Time Trend Analysis**: Daily, weekly, and monthly ordering patterns
- **Top Products**: Ranking of best-performing coffee products

All visualizations are connected to slicers and filters, allowing users to drill down into specific dimensions for deeper analysis.

## Excel Workbook Structure

The workbook is organized into several key sections:

- **Dashboard**: Main interactive visualization interface
- **Data**: Cleaned and structured coffee orders dataset
- **Lookup Tables**: Reference tables for products, regions, etc.
- **Analysis**: Supporting calculations and pivot tables
- **Documentation**: Methodology notes and formula explanations

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are key recommendations for a coffee business:

1. Expand light roast offerings with a focus on Ethiopian and Colombian single-origins, which show the strongest growth trends.

2. Introduce a tiered subscription program with customization options to convert more one-time buyers to high-value subscription customers.

3. Consider regional-specific marketing campaigns that highlight dark roasts in the Midwest and light roasts in Western markets.

4. Optimize staffing and production schedules around identified peak ordering times to improve customer service and efficiency.

5. Develop bundle offerings that pair popular primary products with complementary items to increase average order value.

## Future Analysis Opportunities

This project could be expanded in several directions:

- Integration with customer demographic data for deeper segmentation
- Incorporation of inventory costs for more precise profitability analysis
- Addition of marketing campaign data to measure promotion effectiveness
- Inclusion of customer retention metrics and lifetime value calculations
- Development of forecasting models for demand prediction

## Technical Requirements

To fully utilize this Excel workbook:
- Microsoft Excel 2016 or later recommended
- Enable macros for full dashboard functionality
- Data connections may need to be updated if the source data location changes
