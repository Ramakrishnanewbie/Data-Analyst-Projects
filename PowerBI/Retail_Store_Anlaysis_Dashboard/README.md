# American Key Retailer Dashboard

## Project Background

This Beverage Retailer Dashboard was developed to address a critical business need for a national beverage distributor working with key retail partners across the United States. The company needed a comprehensive view of their product performance across different retail channels, geographic regions, and beverage brands. Prior to this dashboard, sales data was fragmented across multiple reports, making it difficult to identify trends, optimize inventory, and develop targeted marketing strategies.

I created this Power BI solution to transform raw sales data into an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for sales teams, marketing strategists, and executive leadership, enabling data-driven decisions to maximize revenue and market share.

## Business Objectives

The dashboard addresses several key business questions:

- How are sales performing across different regions and retail locations?
- Which beverage brands and products drive the most revenue and units sold?
- What are the quarterly and monthly sales trends across the product portfolio?
- How does each retailer contribute to overall sales performance?
- Which geographic markets show the highest growth potential or concerning decline?
- How do seasonal patterns affect different beverage categories?

## Data Sources & Structure

The dashboard is built using data from multiple sources:
- Point-of-sale transaction systems
- Distributor inventory management systems
- Retail partner sales reports
- Geographic and demographic market data
- Product catalog with categorization

2. **Brand Distribution**: Coca-Cola dominated the brand portfolio with 24.1% of unit sales (4M units), while specialty brands like Diet Coke (12.37%) showed strong performance in specific regions.

3. **Retailer Analysis**: Sodapop emerged as the top-performing retail partner with $4.4M in sales, more than double the next highest retailer, highlighting a potential risk of channel concentration.
